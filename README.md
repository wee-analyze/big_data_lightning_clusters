# big_data_lightning_clusters
Use Powershell codes to quickly configure Big Data clusters in Microsoft Azure (Comments written in Swedish)

If you are using Big Data technology, such as Hadoop and Spark, on a daily basis to process data, then using scripts are a much faster 
more efficient and effective way to get clusters up and running. The scripts in this repository include:
making a resource group, storage account, container, and cluster from scratch
- making a cluster that connects to an already set up container
- deleting the cluster
- deleting a resource group
- The scripts can be run in Powershell or even Cloudshell, https://shell.azure.com, to create consistent clusters everytime. 

If running the scripts from Cloudshell, they should be placed in the clouddrive file share.
*The codes have notes written in Swedish.
